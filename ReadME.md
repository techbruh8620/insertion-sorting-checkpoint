# In this insertion sorting we are working with a playing cards that will retrurn our desired outcome from the element of an array.

### This algorithm returns an expected value each time we work only with the first 1 element from of the array.


- The algorithms takes an array of elements to be sorted.

- The number of elements in the array.

- A nexted iterative approach is adopted to loop over the elements of the array.
